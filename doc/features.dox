\section solvers_list List of optimal control solvers 
The following three solvers are available:
- `robotoc::OCPSolver`: Optimal control solver for robot systems with rigid contacts and/or a floating base.
- `robotoc::UnconstrOCPSolver`: Optimal control solver for robot systems without rigid contacts or a floating base. More efficient than `robotoc::OCPSolver`.
- `robotoc::UnconstrParNMPCSolver`: Optimal control solver for robot systems without rigid contacts or a floating base. Possibly very efficient when the number of available CPU cores is very large.

\section common_features Common features among solvers
The common features in mathematical formulation, algorithms, and implementation among these three solvers are as follows: 
- <b>Direct multiple shooting method</b>:
    - has a nice convergence property.
    - fully leverages parallel computation of the KKT system with OpenMP.
- <b>Primal-dual interior point method</b>: 
    - can treat many inequality constraints including nonlinear ones very efficiently.
    - allows infeasible initial guess of the solution.
    - enables us to perform very fast suboptimal MPC by fixing the barrier parameter.
- <b>Gauss-Newton method</b>:
    - improves computational speed and numerical conditioning.
- <b>Structure-exploting algorithms to compute Newton steps</b>: 
    - can compute the Newton steps with linear time complexity with respect to the length of the horizon.
- <b>Very fast rigid body kinematics and dynamics computation</b> thanks to [Pinocchio](https://github.com/stack-of-tasks/pinocchio).
    - [Pinocchio](https://github.com/stack-of-tasks/pinocchio) provides very efficient forward kinematics, kinematics Jacobians, the recursive Newton Euler algorithm (RNEA), and derivatives of the RNEA.
    - [Pinocchio](https://github.com/stack-of-tasks/pinocchio) also gives us an interface to construct a robot model (`robotoc::Robot`) via URDF files.
- <b>Versatile cost function and constraints interface</b>:
    - new cost compoments can be easily defined by inheriting `robotoc::CostFunctionComponentBase`.
    - The cost function can be easily be constructed by collecting cost components into `robotoc::CostFunction`
    - new constraint compoments can be easily defined by inheriting `robotoc::ConstraintComponentBase` or `robotoc::ImpulseConstraintComponentBase`.
    - The constraints can be easily be constructed by collecting constraint components into `robotoc::Constraints`

\section ocp_solver robotoc::OCPSolver

\subsection ocp_solver_features Features
`robotoc::OCPSolver` is an optimal control solver for robot systems with rigid contacts and/or a floating base.
This is the main solver of `robotoc`.
The unique features of `robotoc::OCPSolver` are:
- <b>Multiphase optimal control problem</b> construction through contact sequence interface: 
    - `robotoc::ContactSequence` interface enables us to formulate the complicated optimal control problems involving changes of dynamics and state jumps due to rigid contacts.
- <b>Lifted contact dynamics</b> [1]: 
    - Relaxes the high nonlinearity in optimization problems typically caused by inequality constraints treated by the interior point methods.
- <b>Riccati recursion to compute Newton steps</b>: 
    - Computes the Newton steps with linear time complexity with respect to the length of the horizon.
- <b>Constraint transformation of pure-state constraints for efficient Riccati recursion</b> [2]: 
    - The pure-state equality constraints representing the switching constraints are treated very efficiently while preserving accuracy and guaranteeing optimality by the constraint transformation.

\subsection unconstr_ocp_solver_features Features
`robotoc::UnconstrOCPSolver` is an optimal control solver for robot systems without rigid contacts or a floating base. This is recommended than `robotoc::OCPSolver` for such systems.
The unique features of `robotoc::UnconstrOCPSolver` are:
- <b>Inverse dynamics based formulation</b> [3]: 
    - Inverse dynamics-based formulation enables very fast computation compared with the forward dynamics-based formulation. You can check this fact easily by comparing `robotoc::UnconstrOCPSolver` and `robotoc::OCPSolver`.
- <b>Riccati recursion to compute Newton steps</b>: 
    - Computes the Newton steps with linear time complexity with respect to the length of the horizon.

\section unconstr_parnmpc_solver robotoc::UnconstrParNMPCSolver
\subsection unconstr_parnmpc_solver_features Features
`robotoc::UnconstrParNMPCSolver` is an optimal control solver for robot systems without rigid contacts or a floating base. This is recommended than `robotoc::UnconstrOCPSolver` if the available number of CPU cores are very large.
The unique features of `robotoc::UnconstrParNMPCSolver` are:
- <b>Inverse dynamics based formulation</b> [3]: 
    - Inverse dynamics-based formulation enables very fast computation compared with the forward dynamics-based formulation. 
- <b>highly parallelizable Newton-type method</b> [4]: 
    - This method can parallelize all steps of Newton-step computation while the Riccati recursion needs serial computation in solving the KKT system. Note that the convergence speed can decrease because this method introduces an approximation for parallelization.
